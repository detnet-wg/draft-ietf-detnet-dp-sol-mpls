1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by
   a network to DetNet flows.  DetNet provides these flows with a low
   packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end delivery latency.
   General background and concepts of DetNet can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].

   This document specifies the DetNet data plane and the on-wire
   encapsulation of DetNet flows over an MPLS-based Packet Switched
   Network (PSN).  The specified encapsulation provides the building
   blocks to enable the DetNet service layer functions and allow flow
   identification as described in the DetNet Architecture.

   The DetNet transport layer functionality that provides congestion
   protection for DetNet flows is assumed to be in place in a DetNet
   node.

   Furthermore, this document also describes how DetNet flows are
   identified, and how a DetNet Relay/Edge/Transit nodes works.  It also
   describes the function and operation of the Packet Replication (PRF)
   Packet Elimination (PEF) and Packet Ordering (POF) functions in the
   MPLS data plane.

   This document does not define the associated control plane functions,
   or Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).  It also does
   not specify traffic handling capabilities required to deliver
   congestion protection and latency control for DetNet flows at the
   DetNet transport layer.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Terms used in this document

   This document uses the terminology established in the DetNet
   architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and the DetNet Data Plane
   Solution Alternatives [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-alt].

   T-Label       A label used to identify the LSP used to transport a
                 DetNet flow across an MPLS PSN, e.g., a hop-by-hop
                 label used between label switching routers (LSR).

   S-Label       A DetNet "service" label that is used between DetNet
                 nodes that implement also the DetNet service layer
                 functions.  An S-Label is also used to identify a
                 DetNet flow at DetNet service layer.

   PEF           A Packet Elimination Function (PEF) eliminates
                 duplicate copies of packets received by an edge or a
                 relay node to prevent excess packets flooding the
                 network, or to prevent duplicate packets being sent out
                 of the DetNet domain.

   PRF           A Packet Replication Function (PRF) replicates DetNet
                 flow packets and forwards them to one or more next hops
                 in the DetNet domain.  The number of packet copies sent
                 to each next hop is a DetNet flow specific parameter at
                 the node doing the replication.  PRF can be implemented
                 by an edge node, a relay node, or an end system.

   POF           A Packet Ordering Function (POF) re-orders packets
                 within a DetNet flow that are received out of order.
                 This function can be implemented by an edge node, a
                 relay node, or an end system.

   PREOF         Collective name for Packet Replication, Elimination,
                 and Ordering Functions.

   d-CW          A DetNet Control Word (d-CW) is used for sequencing and
                 identifying duplicate packets of a DetNet flow at the
                 DetNet service layer.

4.  MPLS DetNet data plane overview

4.1.  Layers of DetNet data plane

   This document describes how DetNet flows are carried over MPLS
   networks.  The DetNet Architecture, [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture],
   decomposes the DetNet data plane into two layers: a service layer and
   a transport layer.  The basic approach defined in this document
   supports the DetNet service layer based on existing pseudowire (PW)
   encapsulations and mechanisms, and supports the DetNet transport
   layer based on existing MPLS Traffic Engineering encapsulations and
   mechanisms.  Background on PWs can be found in [RFC3985] and
   [RFC3031].

              Figure 1: DetNet adaptation to MPLS data plane

   The MPLS DetNet data plane approach defined in this document is shown
   in Figure 1.  The service layer is supported by a DetNet control word
   (d-CW) which conforms to the Generic PW MPLS Control Word (PWMCW)
   defined in [RFC4385].  A d-CW identifying service label (S-Label) is

   also used.  The transport layer is supported by one or labels
   (T-Labels).

   A node operating on a DetNet flow in the Detnet layer, i.e. a node
   processing a DetNet packet which has the S-label as top of stack uses
   the local context associated with that S-label to determine what
   local operation(s) are applied to that packet.  The S-label has to be
   unique on each edge and relay node, which is achieved by using a
   label taken from the platform label space [RFC3031].

             Figure 2: A TSN over DetNet MPLS Enabled Network

   Figure 2 shows several node types defined in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].  DetNet Edge Nodes sit at the
   boundary of a DetNet domain.  They are responsible for mapping non-
   DetNet aware traffic to DetNet services.  They also support the
   imposition and disposition of the required DetNet encapsulation.
   These are functionally similar to pseudowire (PW) Terminating
   Provider Edge (T-PE) nodes which use MPLS-TE LSPs.

   Native TSN flow and DetNet MPLS flow differ not only by the
   additional MPLS specific encapsulation, but DetNet MPLS flows have on
   each DetNet node an associated DetNet specific data structure, what
   defines flow related characteristics and required forwarding
   functions.  Edge Nodes MUST provide a Service Proxy entity that
   "associates" the DetNet flows and native flows at the edge of the
   DetNet domain.  It ensures that the DN Flow is properly served at the
   Edge node (and inside the domain).

   Transit nodes are normal MPLS Label Switching Routers (LSRs).  They
   are generally unaware of the special requirements of DetNet flows,
   although they need to provide traffic engineering services and proper
   QoS to the LSPs associated with DetNet flows to enhance the prospect
   of the LSPs meeting the DetNet service requirements.  Some
   implementations of transit nodes may be DetNet aware, but such nodes
   just support the DetNet transport layer.

   The MPLS LSP may be provided by any MPLS method (provisioned, RSVP-
   TE, MPLS- TP, or MPLS Segment Routing (SR)).

                Figure 3: DetNet (DN) IP Over MPLS Network

   Figure 3 and Figure 4, show different cases where relay nodes may be
   used.  Relay nodes are similar to edge nodes in that both are aware
   of the needs of particular DetNet flows and take care to process them
   in accordance with the required performance needs.  They differ in
   that relay nodes sit within a DetNet domain while edge nodes always
   sit at DetNet domain boundaries.  Both node types can enhance the
   reliability of delivery by enabling the replication of packets so
   that multiple copies, possibly over multiple paths are forwarded
   through the DetNet domain.  They also reduce the impact of
   replication by eliminating surplus copies of DetNet packets.  Relay
   nodes may sit the boundary of an MPLS domain when the non-MPLS domain
   is DetNet aware.  Relay nodes are functionally similar to PW S-PEs
   or, when at the edge of an MPLS network, T-PEs [RFC6073].

   In Figure 8 the numbers are used to identify the instance of a
   packet.  Packet 1 is the original packet, and packets 1.1, and 1.2
   are two first generation copies of packet 1.  Packet 1.2.1 is a
   second generation copy of packet 1.2 etc.  Note that these numbers
   never appear in the packet, and are not to be confused with sequence
   numbers, labels or any other identifier that appears in the packet.
   They simply indicate the generation number of the original packet so
   that its passage through the network fragment can be identified to
   the reader.

   Customer Equipment CE1 sends a packet into the DetNet enabled MPLS
   network.  This is packet (1).  Edge Node EN1 encapsulates the packet
   as a DetNet Packet and sends it to Relay node R1 (packet 1.1).  EN1
   makes a copy of the packet (1.2), encapsulates it and sends this copy
   to Relay node R4.

   Note that along the MPLS path from EN1 to R1 there may be zero or
   more LSRs which, for clarity, are not shown.  The same is true for
   any other path between two DetNet entities shown in Figure 8.

   Relay node R4 has been configured to send one copy of the packet to
   Relay Node R2 (packet 1.2.1) and one copy to Edge Node EN2 (packet
   1.2.2).

   R2 receives packet copy 1.2.1 before packet copy 1.1 arrives, and,
   having been configured to perform packet elimination on this DetNet
   flow, forwards packet 1.2.1 to Relay Node R3.  Packet copy 1.1 is of
   no further use and so is discarded by R2.

   Edge Node EN2 receives packet copy 1.2.2 from R4 before it receives
   packet copy 1.2.1 from R2 via relay Node R3.  EN2 therefore strips
   any DetNet encapsulation from packet copy 1.2.2 and forwards the
   packet to CE2.  When EN2 receives the later packet copy 1.2.1 this is
   discarded.

   The above is of course illustrative of many network scenarios that
   can be configured.  Between a pair of relay nodes there may be one or
   more transport nodes that simply forward the DetNet traffic, but
   these are omitted for clarity.

5.  DetNet MPLS Data Considerations

   This section provides informative considerations related to providing
   DetNet service to flows which are identified based on their header
   information.  At a high level, the following are provided on a per
   flow basis:

   Congestion protection and latency control:

      Usage of allocated resources (queuing, policing, shaping) to
      ensure that the congestion-related loss and latency/jitter
      requirements of a DetNet flow are met.

   Explicit routes:

      Use of a specific path for a flow.  This limits miss-ordering and
      latency.




Korhonen & Varga         Expires August 11, 2019               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


   Service protection:

      Which in the case of this document primarily relates to
      replication and elimination.  Changing the explicit path after a
      failure is detected in order to restore delivery of the required
      DetNet service characteristics is also possible.  Path changes,
      even in the case of failure recovery, can lead to the out of order
      delivery of data.

   Load sharing:

      Generally, distributing packets of the same DetNet flow over
      multiple paths is not recommended.  Such load sharing, e.g., via
      ECMP or UCMP, impacts ordering and end-to-end jitter.

   Troubleshooting:

      For example, to support identification of misbehaving flows.

   Recognize flow(s) for analytics:

      For example, increase counters.

   Correlate events with flows:

      For example, unexpected loss.

   The DetNet data plane also allows for the aggregation of DetNet
   flows, e.g., via MPLS hierarchical LSPs, to improved scaling.  When
   DetNet flows are aggregated, transit nodes may have limited ability
   to provide service on per-flow DetNet identifiers.  Therefore,
   identifying each individual DetNet flow on a transit node may not be
   achieved in some network scenarios, but DetNet service can still be
   assured in these scenarios through resource allocation and control.

5.1.  End-system specific considerations

   Data-flows requiring DetNet service are generated and terminated on
   end-systems.  Encapsulation depends on application and its
   preferences.  In a DetNet (or even a TSN) domain the DN (TSN)
   functions use at most two flow parameters, namely Flow-ID and
   Sequence Number.  However, an application may exchange further flow
   related parameters (e.g., time-stamp), which are not considered by DN
   functions.

   Two types of end-systems are distinguished:

   o  L2 (Ethernet) end-system: application directly over L2.



Korhonen & Varga         Expires August 11, 2019               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


   o  L3 (IP) end-system: application over L3.

   Note: An MPLS DetNet end system (as shown in Figure 5) can be treated
   as a combination of an L3 (IP) end-system and an MPLS DetNet edge
   node.

   In case of Ethernet end-systems the application data is encapsulated
   directly in L2.  From the DN domain perspective no upper layer
   protocols are visible.  The Data-flow uses only Ethernet tag(s) and
   further flow specific parameters (if needed) are hidden inside the
   protocol data unit (PDU).

   The IP end-system scenario is different.  In this case, data-flows
   are encapsulated directly in IP and, typically, other higher layer
   protocols such as UDP and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  Many
   valid combinations exist and it is up to applications to select
   specific headers to be used.  Details on support for DetNet IP data
   flows can be found in [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol-ip].

   As a general rule, DetNet domains MUST be capable of forwarding any
   Data-flows and the DetNet domain MUST NOT mandate the end-system
   encapsulation format.

   Furthermore, no application-level-proxy function is envisioned inside
   the DetNet domain, so end-systems peer with end-systems using the
   same application encapsulation format (see figure below):

   o  L2 end-systems peer with L2 end-systems and

   o  L3 end-systems peer with L3 end-systems.

                Figure 9: End-systems and the DetNet domain

5.2.  DetNet domain specific considerations

   From a connection type perspective, three scenarios are
   distinguished:

   1.  Directly attached: end-system is directly connected to an edge
       node.

   2.  Indirectly attached: end-system is behind a (L2-TSN / L3-DetNet)
       sub-network.

   3.  DN integrated: end-system is part of the DetNet domain.

   L3 end-systems may use any of these connection types, however L2 end-
   systems may use only the first two (directly or indirectly attached).
   DetNet domain MUST allow communication between any end-systems of the
   same type (L2-L2, L3-L3), independent of their connection type and
   DetNet capability.  However directly attached and indirectly attached
   end-systems have no knowledge about the DetNet domain and its
   encapsulation format at all.  See Figure 10 for L3 end-system
   scenarios.

5.2.1.  DetNet Layer Two Service

   The simplest DetNet service is to provide tunneling for layer two,
   where the connected hosts are in the same broadcast (BC) domain.
   Forwarding over the DetNet domain is based on L2 (MAC) addresses
   (i.e. dst-MAC), or on received interface [RFC3985].  In both cases
   the L2 headers MUST either be kept, or provision must be made for
   their reconstruction at egress from the DetNet domain.

5.3.  DetNet Inter-Working Function (DN-IWF)

5.3.1.  Networks with multiple technology segments

   There are networking scenarios, where the DetNet domain contains
   multiple technology segments (IP, MPLS, ..) and all those segments
   are under the same administrative control (see Figure 13).
   Furthermore, DetNet nodes may be interconnected via TSN segments.

   An important aspect of DetNet network design is the placement of
   DetNet functions across the domain.  Designs based on segment-by-
   segment optimization can provide only sub-optimal solutions.  In
   order to achieve global optimized Inter-Working Functions (DN-IWF)
   can be placed at segment edge nodes, which stitch together DetNet
   flows across connected segments.

   DN-IWF may ensure that flow attributes are correlated across segment
   edges.  For example, there are two DetNet functions which require
   Sequence Numbers: (1) PEF: removes duplications from flows and (2)
   POF: ensures in-order-delivery of packet in a flow.  Stitching flows
   together and correlating attributes means for example that
   replication of packets can happen in one segment and elimination of
   duplicates in a different one.

5.3.2.  DN-IWF related considerations

   The goal of DN-IWF is to (1) match and (2) translate segment specific
   flow attributes.  The DN-IWF ensures that segment specific attributes
   comprise per domain unique attributes for the whole DetNet domain.
   This characteristic can ensure that DetNet functions can be based on
   per domain attributes and not per segment attributes.

   The two DetNet specific attributes have the following
   characteristics:

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


   o  Flow-ID: it is same in all packets of a flow

   o  Sequence Number: it is different packet-by-packet

   For the Flow-ID the DN-IWF can implement a static mapping.  The
   situation is more complicated for Sequence Number as it is different
   packet-by-packet, so it may need more sophisticated translation
   unless its format is exactly the same in the two technology segments.
   In this later case the DN-IWF can simple copy the Sequence Number
   field between the tunneling encapsulation of the two technology
   segments.

   In case of three technology segments (IP, MPLS and TSN) three DN-IWF
   functions can be specified.  In the rest of this section the focus is
   on the (1) IP - MPLS network scenario.  Note: the use-cases are out-
   of-scope for (2) TSN - IP, (3) TSN - MPLS.

   Simplest implementation of DN-IWF is provided if the flow attributes
   have the same format.  Such a common denominator of the tunnel
   encapsulation format is the pseudowire encapsulation over both IP and
   MPLS.

6.  MPLS-based DetNet data plane solution

6.1.  DetNet over MPLS Encapsulation Components

   To carry DetNet over MPLS the following is required:

   1.  A method of identifying the MPLS payload type.





Korhonen & Varga         Expires August 11, 2019               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


   2.  A method of identifying the DetNet flow group to the processing
       element.

   3.  A method of distinguishing DetNet OAM packets from DetNet data
       packets.

   4.  A method of carrying the DetNet sequence number.

   5.  A suitable LSP to deliver the packet to the egress PE.

   6.  A method of carrying queuing and forwarding indication.

   In this design an MPLS service label (the S-Label), similar to a
   pseudowire (PW) label [RFC3985], is used to identify both the DetNet
   flow identity and the payload MPLS payload type satisfying (1) and
   (2) in the list above.  OAM traffic discrimination happens through
   the use of the Associated Channel method described in [RFC4385].  The
   sequence number is carried in the DetNet Control word which carries
   the Data/OAM discriminator.  The LSP used to transport the DetNet
   packet may be of any type (MPLS-LDP, MPLS-TE, MPLS-TP [RFC5921], or
   MPLS-SR [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls]).  The LSP (T-Label)
   label and/or the S-Label may be used to indicate the queue processing
   as well as the forwarding parameters.

   To simplify implementation and to maximize interoperability two
   sequence number sizes are supported: a 16 bit sequence number and a
   28 bit sequence number.  The 16 bit sequence number is needed to
   support some types of legacy clients.  The 28 bit sequence number is
   used in situations where it is necessary ensure that in high speed
   networks the sequence number space does not wrap whilst packets are
   in flight.  In addition it must be possible to send a packet with a
   zero length sequence number, to support the case where sequence
   numbers are not required by a particular DetNet flow.

   Note that the concept of a zero length sequence number is not to be
   confused with a sequence number of zero.  For example, were the
   sequence number size is 16 bits, the sequence will contain: 65535, 0,
   1.  In this case zero is an ordinary sequence number.  Unlike
   [RFC4448] a sequence number of zero does not indicate that no
   sequence number is in use.  Where sequence numbers are not in use,
   and thus a zero length sequence number is in used, the sequence
   number field in the packet is sent as zero.  The DetNet packet
   forwarder knows which of these cases applies through configuration
   parameters associated with each specific DetNet flow.

   Note that when the network consists only of DetNet enabled nodes with
   no aggregation, Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) means that the only
   label in the label stack may be the S-label.

6.2.  MPLS data plane encapsulation

   Figure 15 illustrates a DetNet data plane MPLS encapsulation.  The
   MPLS-based encapsulation of the DetNet flows is a good fit for the
   Layer-2 interconnect deployment cases (see Figure 4).  Furthermore,
   end to end DetNet service i.e., native DetNet deployment (see
   Figure 5) is also possible if DetNet end systems are capable of
   initiating and termination MPLS encapsulated packets.

   The MPLS-based DetNet data plane encapsulation consists of:

   o  DetNet control word (d-CW) containing sequencing information for
      packet replication and duplicate elimination purposes, and the OAM
      indicator.  There MUST be a separate sequence number space for
      each DetNet flow.

   o  DetNet service Label (S-label) that identifies a DetNet flow to
      the peer node that is to process it.  The S-Label is allocated
      from the platform label space [RFC3031].

   o  Zero or more MPLS transport LSP label(s) (T-label) used to direct
      the packet along the label switched path (LSP) to the next peer
      node along the path.  When Penultimate Hop Popping is in use there
      may be no label T-label in the protocol stack on the final hop.

   o  The necessary data-link encapsulation is then applied prior to
      transmission over the physical media.

6.3.  DetNet control word

   A DetNet control word (d-CW) conforms to the Generic PW MPLS Control
   Word (PWMCW) defined in [RFC4385] and is illustrated in Figure 16.
   The upper nibble of the d-CW MUST be set to zero (0).  Two sequence
   number sizes are supported: 16 bits and 28 bits.  The sequence number
   size in use for the d-CW associated with a DetNet flow (S-Label) is
   configured either by a control plane or manually for each DetNet
   flow.  The sequence number is aligned to the right (least significant
   bits) and unused bits MUST be set to zero (0).  Each DetNet flow MUST
   have its own sequence number counter.  The sequence number is
   incremented by one for each new packet.

   As discussed in Section 6, zero is an ordinary sequence number with
   no special meaning.  Also as discussed therein, where no sequence
   number is used by a particular DetNet flow, the sequence number field
   in the d-CW is set to zero.

   The d-CW MUST always be present in a packet.  In a case where the
   sequence number is not used (e.g., for DetNet-t-flows) a zero length
   sequence number is used and the sequence number MUST be set to zero
   (0).

6.4.  Flow Identification

   DetNet flow identification at a DetNet service layer is realized by
   an S-label.  The S-label is allocated from the platform label space
   [RFC3031] which means that the DetNet flow is correctly identified
   and matched to the flow parameters, including the flow history,
   regardless of which input interface the packet arrives on.

   While the S-Label will usually be at the bottom of the label stack,
   immediately preceding the d-DW, there may be cases where there are
   additional label stack entries beneath it.  For example, when an OAM
   Associated Channel Header (ACH) [RFC4385] is carried that applies to
   the S-Label, a GAL [RFC5586] will be in the label stack below the
   S-Label.

   Similarly, an Entropy Label Indicator/Entropy Label (ELI/EL)
   [RFC6790] may be carried below the S-Label in the label stack in
   order to control or prevent ECMP treatment for packets in a DetNet
   flow (the use of the same EL for all of the packets in a flow forces
   the flow to follow the same path when otherwise ECMP is in use in a
   network).  However, as previously stated in Section 5, the use of
   ECMP in a DetNet domain is not recommended.

   The S-label for a specific DetNet flow is unique to that DetNet flow
   on a specific node, but is not required to be identical with the
   S-label for that DetNet flow in any other node within the DetNet
   domain.  Thus the S-label can only be used to identify the DetNet
   flow at the intended receiving node.

6.5.  Indication of the DetNet Payload Type

   The only nodes that needs to know the payload type of a flow are the
   DetNet ingress node and the DetNet egress nodes.  The ingress node
   has to know how to process the packet it receives from the ingress AC
   or IP flow, and the egress edge node has to know how to prepare the
   packet for transmission to the next hop.

   On ingress a DetNet edge node has to classify the packets into those
   that are for transmission as Detnet packets and those that are for

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


   transmission as "normal" packets at one of more lower priorities.
   The packet type is indicated to the egress edge node through the
   value of the S-label.  Thus, when the egress edge node looks up the
   S-label one of the parameters returned is the packet type which in
   turn tells the egress edge node how to prepare the packet for
   transmission to a next hop.

   The consequence of this approach is that if multiple packet
   encapsulations are processed on a node pair, each encapsulation will
   need its own S-Label.  That is not generally a problems, since it is
   anticipated that only one encapsulation type will be present for each
   DetNet flow.  Of course, if for some reason the multiple
   encapsulations are needed to support a single DetNet service,
   multiple S-labels will be required for that service.  Note that in
   the unlikely case that Ipv4 and IPv6 will map to the same DetNet
   flow, different S-labels will be needed to differentiate between the
   versions of IP.

6.6.  OAM Indication

   OAM follows the procedures set out in [RFC5085] with the restriction
   that only Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) type 1 is
   supported.

   As shown in Figure 3 of [RFC5085] when the first nibble of the d-CW
   is 0x0 the payload following the d-CW is normal user data.  However,
   when the first nibble of the d-CW is 0X1, the payload that follows
   the d-DW is an OAM payload with the OAM type indicated by the value
   in the d-CW Channel Type field.

   The reader is referred to [RFC5085] for a more detailed description
   of the Associated Channel mechanism, and to the DetNet work on OAM
   for more information DetNet OAM.

   study.

   the queuing/shaping/ policing implications) will be covered in other
   documents.

   The ability to aggregate individual flows, and their associated
   resource control, into a larger aggregate is an important technique
   for improving scaling of control in the data, management and control
   planes.  The DetNet data plane allows for the aggregation of DetNet
   flows, to improved scaling.  There are three methods of introducing
   flow aggregation:

   The following review comments were received when this section was
   committed to github.

   General comment: We should points to the major issue of aggregation,
   namely the Seq.Num related problem.  The aggregated flows have their
   own Seq.Num and those are independent.  We should consider to group
   the aggregation techniques as per their impact on what DetNet
   functions they allow on a DetNet flow.  (E.g., aggregation without
   new Aggregate.Seq.Num would prohibit usage of FR, EF and in-order-
   delivery function on the aggregate flow).

   SR based aggregation can be treated as a form of H-LSP aggregation.
   Should we differentiate them?  What are the differences?

   What are the issues when aggregating of different payload types?
   Should we add an editor note on this?

   Simple-aggregation-at-the-detnet-layer: is this not the same as
   H-LSP?  The A-label can be treated just as an additional T-label.

   End of review comment.

6.7.1.  Aggregation at the LSP

   DetNet flows transported via MPLS can leverage MPLS-TE?s existing
   support for hierarchical LSPs (H-LSPs), see [RFC4206].  H-LSPs are
   typically used to aggregate control and resources, they may also be
   used to provide OAM or protection for the aggregated LSPs.  Arbitrary
   levels of aggregation naturally falls out of the definition for
   hierarchy and the MPLS label stack [RFC3032].  DetNet nodes which
   support aggregation (LSP hierarchy) map one or more LSPs (labels)
   into and from an H-LSP.  Both carried LSPs and H-LSPs may or may not
   use the TC field, i.e., L-LSPs or E-LSPs.  Such nodes will need to
   ensure that traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/
   enqueued) onto the H-LSPs in a fashion that ensures the required
   DetNet service is preserved.

   Additional details of the traffic control capabilities needed at a
   DetNet-aware node may be covered in the new service descriptions
   mentioned above or in separate future documents.  Management and
   control plane mechanisms will also need to ensure that the service

   required on the aggregate flow (H-LSP or DSCP) are provided, which
   may include the discarding or remarking mentioned in the previous
   sections.

6.7.2.  Aggregating DetNet flows as a new DetNet flow

   An aggregate can be built by layering DetNet flows as shown below:

   |           Physical              |
   +---------------------------------+

   Both the Aggregation (A) label and the S-label have their MPLS S bit
   set indicating bottom of stack, and the d-CW allows the PREOF to
   work.

   It is a property of the A-label that what follows is d-CW followed by
   an S-label.  A relay node processing the A-label would not know the
   underlying payload type.  This would only be known to a node that was
   a peer of the node imposing the S-label.  However there is no real
   need for it to know the payload type during aggregation processing.

6.7.3.  Simple Aggregation at the DetNet layer

   Another approach would be not to include a d-CW for the aggregated
   flow.  This would be functionally similar to aggregation at the
   transport layer using H-LSPs, but would confine knowledge of the
   aggregation to the DetNet layer.  Such an approach shares the
   disadvantage that PREOF operations would not be possible.  OAM
   operation in this mode is for further study.

6.8.  Service Layer Considerations

   The edge and relay node internal procedures related to PREOF are
   implementation specific.  The order of a packet elimination or
   replication is out of scope in this specification.  However, care
   should be taken that the replication function does not actually
   loopback packets as "replicas".  Looped back packets include
   artificial delay when the node that originally initiated the packet
   receives it again.  Also, looped back packets may make the network
   condition to look healthier than it actually is (in some cases link
   failures are not reflected properly because looped back packets make
   the situation appear better than it actually is).

   It is important that the DetNet layer is configured such that a
   DetNet node never receives its own replicated packets.  If it were to
   receive such packets the replication function would make the loop
   more destructive of bandwidth than a conventional unicast loop.
   Ultimately the TTL in the S-Label will cause the packet to die during
   a transient, but given the sensitivity of applications to packet
   latency the impact on the DetNet application would be severe.

6.8.1.  Edge node processing

   An edge node is resposable for matching ingress packets to the
   service they require and encapsulating them accordingly.An edge node
   may participate in the packet replication and duplication
   elimination.

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


   The DetNet-aware forwarder selects the egress DetNet member flow
   segment based on the flow identification.  The mapping of ingress
   DetNet member flow segment to egress DetNet member flow segment may
   be statically or dynamically configured.  Additionally the DetNet-
   aware forwarder does duplicate frame elimination based on the flow
   identification and the sequence number combination.  The packet
   replication is also done within the DetNet-aware forwarder.  During
   elimination and the replication process the sequence number of the
   DetNet member flow MUST be preserved and copied to the egress DetNet
   member flow.

   The internal design of a relay node is out of scope of this document.
   However the reader's attention is drawn to the need to make any PREOF
   state available to the packet processor(s) dealing with packets to
   which the PREOF functions must be applied, and to maintain that state
   is such as way that it is available to the packet processor operation
   on the next packet in the DetNet flow (which may be a duplicate, a
   late packet, or the next packet in sequence.

   [Editor's note: I think the rest of this section belongs in a new
   "802.1 TSN (island Interconnect) over MPLS DetNet" section.]

   This may be done in the DetNet layer, or where the native service
   processing (NSP) [RFC3985] is IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB] capable, the
   packet replication and duplicate elimination MAY entirely be done in
   the NSP, bypassing the DetNet flow encapsulation and logic entirely.
   This enables operating over unmodified implementations and
   deployments.  The NSP approach works only between edge nodes and
   cannot make use of relay nodes.

   The NSP approach is useful end to end tunnel and for for "island
   interconnect" scenarios.  However, when there is a need to do PREOF
   in a middle of the network, such plain edge to edge operation is not
   sufficient.

   The extended forwarder MAY copy the sequencing information from the
   native DetNet packet into the DetNet sequence number field and vice
   versa.  If there is no existing sequencing information available in
   the native packet or the forwarder chose not to copy it from the
   native packet, then the extended forwarder MUST maintain a sequence
   number counter for each DetNet flow (indexed by the DetNet flow
   identification).

6.8.2.  Relay node processing

   A DetNet Relay node operates in the DetNet transport layer . This
   processing is done within an extended forwarder function.  Whether an
   ingress DetNet member flow receives DetNet specific processing

   depends on how the forwarding is programmed.  Some relay nodes may be
   DetNet service aware, while others may be unmodified LSRs that only
   understand how to swicth MPLS-TE LSPs.

   It is also possible to treat the relay node as a transit node, see
   Section 6.9.3.  Again, this is entirely up to how the forwarding has
   been programmed.

6.9.  Other DetNet data plane considerations

6.9.1.  Class of Service

   [Editor's note: this section needs to updated to discuss how DetNet
   service is mapped to E- and L-LSPs.  Perhaps this gets merged with
   the aggregation section or dropped?]

   Class and quality of service, i.e., CoS and QoS, are terms that are
   often used interchangeably and confused with each other.  In the
   context of DetNet, CoS is used to refer to mechanisms that provide
   traffic forwarding treatment based on aggregate group basis and QoS
   is used to refer to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding
   treatment based on a specific DetNet flow basis.  Examples of
   existing network level CoS mechanisms include DiffServ which is
   enabled by IP header differentiated services code point (DSCP) field
   [RFC2474] and MPLS label traffic class field [RFC5462], and at Layer-
   2, by IEEE 802.1p priority code point (PCP).

   CoS for DetNet flows carried in PWs and MPLS is provided using the
   existing MPLS Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture
   [RFC3270].  Both E-LSP and L-LSP MPLS DiffServ modes MAY be used to
   support DetNet flows.  The Traffic Class field (formerly the EXP
   field) of an MPLS label follows the definition of [RFC5462] and
   [RFC3270].  The Uniform, Pipe, and Short Pipe DiffServ tunneling and
   TTL processing models are described in [RFC3270] and [RFC3443] and
   MAY be used for MPLS LSPs supporting DetNet flows.  MPLS ECN MAY also
   be used as defined in ECN [RFC5129] and updated by [RFC5462].

   CoS for DetNet flows carried in IPv6 is provided using the standard
   differentiated services code point (DSCP) field [RFC2474] and related
   mechanisms.  The 2-bit explicit congestion notification (ECN)
   [RFC3168] field MAY also be used.

   One additional consideration for DetNet nodes which support CoS
   services is that they MUST ensure that the CoS service classes do not
   impact the congestion protection and latency control mechanisms used
   to provide DetNet QoS.  This requirement is similar to requirement
   for MPLS LSRs to that CoS LSPs do not impact the resources allocated
   to TE LSPs via [RFC3473].

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


6.9.2.  Quality of Service

   Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms for flow specific traffic
   treatment typically includes a guarantee/agreement for the service,
   and allocation of resources to support the service.  Example QoS
   mechanisms include discrete resource allocation, admission control,
   flow identification and isolation, and sometimes path control,
   traffic protection, shaping, policing and remarking.  Example
   protocols that support QoS control include Resource ReSerVation
   Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] (RSVP) and RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].
   The existing MPLS mechanisms defined to support CoS [RFC3270] can
   also be used to reserve resources for specific traffic classes.

   In addition to explicit routes, and packet replication and
   elimination, described in Section 6 above, DetNet provides zero
   congestion loss and bounded latency and jitter.  As described in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture], there are different mechanisms that
   maybe used separately or in combination to deliver a zero congestion
   loss service.  These mechanisms are provided by the either the MPLS
   or IP layers, and may be combined with the mechanisms defined by the
   underlying network layer such as 802.1TSN.

   A baseline set of QoS capabilities for DetNet flows carried in PWs
   and MPLS can provided by MPLS with Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
   [RFC3209] and [RFC3473].  TE LSPs can also support explicit routes
   (path pinning).  Current service definitions for packet TE LSPs can
   be found in "Specification of the Controlled Load Quality of
   Service", [RFC2211], "Specification of Guaranteed Quality of
   Service", [RFC2212], and "Ethernet Traffic Parameters", [RFC6003].
   Additional service definitions are expected in future documents to
   support the full range of DetNet services.  In all cases, the
   existing label-based marking mechanisms defined for TE-LSPs and even
   E-LSPs are use to support the identification of flows requiring
   DetNet QoS.

   Packets that are marked with a DetNet Class of Service value, but
   that have not been the subject of a completed reservation, can
   disrupt the QoS offered to properly reserved DetNet flows by using
   resources allocated to the reserved flows.  Therefore, the network
   nodes of a DetNet network:

   o  MUST defend the DetNet QoS by discarding or remarking (to a non-
      DetNet CoS) packets received that are not the subject of a
      completed reservation.

   o  MUST NOT use a DetNet reserved resource, e.g. a queue or shaper
      reserved for DetNet flows, for any packet that does not carry a
      DetNet Class of Service marker.

6.9.3.  Cross-DetNet flow resource aggregation

   [Editor's NOTE: keep and extend this section.]

   The ability to aggregate individual flows, and their associated
   resource control, into a larger aggregate is an important technique
   for improving scaling of control in the data, management and control
   planes.  This document identifies the traffic identification related
   aspects of aggregation of DetNet flows.  The resource control and
   management aspects of aggregation (including the queuing/shaping/
   policing implications) will be covered in other documents.  The data
   plane implications of aggregation are independent for PW/MPLS and IP
   encapsulated DetNet flows.

   DetNet flows transported via MPLS can leverage MPLS-TE's existing
   support for hierarchical LSPs (H-LSPs), see [RFC4206].  H-LSPs are
   typically used to aggregate control and resources, they may also be
   used to provide OAM or protection for the aggregated LSPs.  Arbitrary
   levels of aggregation naturally falls out of the definition for
   hierarchy and the MPLS label stack [RFC3032].  DetNet nodes which
   support aggregation (LSP hierarchy) map one or more LSPs (labels)
   into and from an H-LSP.  Both carried LSPs and H-LSPs may or may not
   use the TC field, i.e., L-LSPs or E-LSPs.  Such nodes will need to
   ensure that traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/
   enqueued) onto the H-LSPs in a fashion that ensures the required
   DetNet service is preserved.

   DetNet flows transported via IP have more limited aggregation
   options, due to the available traffic flow identification fields of
   the IP solution.  One available approach is to manage the resources
   associated with a DSCP identified traffic class and to map (remark)
   individually controlled DetNet flows onto that traffic class.  This
   approach also requires that nodes support aggregation ensure that
   traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/enqueued) in
   a fashion that ensures the required DetNet service is preserved.

   In both the MPLS and IP cases, additional details of the traffic
   control capabilities needed at a DetNet-aware node may be covered in
   the new service descriptions mentioned above or in separate future
   documents.  Management and control plane mechanisms will also need to
   ensure that the service required on the aggregate flow (H-LSP or
   DSCP) are provided, which may include the discarding or remarking
   mentioned in the previous sections.

6.9.4.  Layer 2 addressing and QoS Considerations

   [Editor's NOTE: review and simplify this section.]

   The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of the IEEE 802.1
   Working Group have defined (and are defining) a number of amendments
   to IEEE 802.1Q [IEEE8021Q] that provide zero congestion loss and
   bounded latency in bridged networks.  IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB]
   defines packet replication and elimination functions that should
   prove both compatible with and useful to, DetNet networks.

   As is the case for DetNet, a Layer 2 network node such as a bridge
   may need to identify the specific DetNet flow to which a packet
   belongs in order to provide the TSN/DetNet QoS for that packet.  It
   also will likely need a CoS marking, such as the priority field of an
   IEEE Std 802.1Q VLAN tag, to give the packet proper service.

   Although the flow identification methods described in IEEE 802.1CB
   [IEEE8021CB] are flexible, and in fact, include IP 5-tuple
   identification methods, the baseline TSN standards assume that every
   Ethernet frame belonging to a TSN stream (i.e.  DetNet flow) carries
   a multicast destination MAC address that is unique to that flow
   within the bridged network over which it is carried.  Furthermore,
   IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB] describes three methods by which a packet
   sequence number can be encoded in an Ethernet frame.

   Ensuring that the proper Ethernet VLAN tag priority and destination
   MAC address are used on a DetNet/TSN packet may require further
   clarification of the customary L2/L3 transformations carried out by
   routers and edge label switches.  Edge nodes may also have to move
   sequence number fields among Layer 2, PW, and IPv6 encapsulations.

6.9.5.  Time Synchronization

   [Editor's Note: A detailed discussion of time synchronization is
   outside the scope of this document, and the production of a
   specialist text discussing this topic is encouraged.  This section
   will be updated/removed if such a document is available before
   publication of this text.]

   Time synchronization is important both from the perspective of
   operating the DetNet network itself and from the perspective of
   transferring time across the network between client applications.
   Some clients may be able to use the DetNet as their provider of time
   and frequency, others may require the DetNet to transfer time between
   a client clock source and a client clock user.

   For example, [RFC8169] describes a method of recording the packet
   queuing time in an MPLS LSR on a packet by per packet basis and
   forwarding this information to the egress edge system.  This allows
   compensation for any variable packet queuing delay to be applied at
   the packet receiver.  Other mechanisms for IP/MPLS networks are
   defined based on IEEE Standard 1588 [IEEE1588], such as ITU-T
   [G.8275.1] and [G.8275.2].

   A more detailed discussion of time synchronization is outside the
   scope of this document.

7.  Management and Control Considerations

   While management plane and control planes are traditionally
   considered separately, from the Data Plane perspective there is no
   practical difference based on the origin of flow provisioning
   information.  This document therefore does not distinguish between
   information provided by distributed control plane protocols, e.g.,
   RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473], or by centralized network management
   mechanisms, e.g., RestConf [RFC8040], YANG [RFC7950], and the Path
   Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller].  That said, there
   are particular considerations and requirements for DetNet that are
   discussed in Section 7.6.

7.1.  MPLS-based data plane

7.1.1.  S-Label assignment and distribution

   DetNet S-Labels (see Section 6.4 for their definition) are similar to
   other service labels that denote the contents of the MPLS packet
   payload being other than a normal routed IP packet, such as a layer 2
   pseudowire, an IP packet that is routed in a VPN context with a
   private address, or an Ethernet virtual private wire service.

   Like other service labels, they are allocated by the downstream
   receiver of DetNet packets from its platform label space.  S-Labels
   uniquely identify a particular DetNet flow, and are local to the node
   on which the label is allocated.  They are used to identify the flow
   that a packet belongs to as it traverses a particular node in a
   DetNet domain.  Because labels are local to each node rather than
   being a global identifier within a domain, they must be advertised to
   their direct upstream peer nodes.

   Much like other MPLS labels, there are a number of alternatives
   available for DetNet S-Label advertisement to a DetNet node's
   upstream peers.  These include distributed signaling protocols such
   as targeted LDP and RSVP-TE and centralized label distribution via a

   controller that manages both the sender and the receiver using
   NETCONF/YANG, BGP, PCEP, etc.  The details of the control plane
   protocol solution required for the label distribution and the
   management of the label number space are out of scope of this
   document, but as mentioned above, there are particular DetNet
   considerations and requirements that are discussed in Section 7.6.

7.1.2.  Explicit routes

   It is necessary to consider explicit routes both at the DetNet layer
   and in the MPLS layer.  In the DetNet layer the explicit route
   consists of the set of Relay Nodes that the DetNet flow must
   traverse.  In the MPLS layer the explicit route consists of the set
   of LSRs, links, and possibly link bundle members and queues that the
   DetNet packets of a flow must traverse between nodes in the DetNet
   layer (i.e. between a specific Edge Node and the next hop Relay Node,
   between specific Relay Nodes, and between a specific Relay node and
   the egress Edge Node.  This detailed steering is needed to ensure
   that packets are routed through the resources that have been reserved
   for them, and hence provide the DetNet application with the required
   performance.

   Whether configuring, calculating and instantiating this is a multi-
   stage process, or a single stage process is out of scope of this
   document.

   The one method of explicitly setting up the explicit path at the
   DetNet layer is through the use of the management controller.

   [Editor's note: a method of setting up a graph through the DetNet
   Nodes using the IGP has been proposed.  A reference is needed to
   e.g., RFC 7813 IS-IS Path Control and Reservation.]

   [Editor's note (Andy): I don't believe that reference belongs in this
   document.  Rather, it should be in a future control plane
   specification.  We need to discuss this further.]

   There are a number of approaches that can be taken to provide
   explicit routes/paths in the MPLS layer:

   o  The path can be explicitly set up by the management controller
      calculating the path and explicitly configuring each node along
      that path.

   o  The LSP can be set up using RSVP-TE.  Such an approach confines
      the packet to the explicit path.

   o  The path can be implemented using MPLS-based segment routing.

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


   See Section 7.6 for further discussion of these alternatives.

   When DetNet traffic is carried over IP (see Section 11) explicit
   paths may need to be provided in the IP layer.  This is for further
   study.

7.2.  Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering (PREOF)

   The control plane protocol solution required for managing the PREOF
   processing is outside the scope of this document.  That said, it must
   be noted that the ability to determine, for a particular flow, packet
   replication and recombination points in the DetNet domain is going to
   require enhancements to existing methods of establishing explicit
   paths through a network.  There may be capabilities that can be
   adopted from technologies like MPLS point-to-multipoint traffic
   engineering [RFC4875].

7.3.  Congestion protection and latency control

   As stated in the Introduction, this document does not specify traffic
   handling capabilities required to deliver congestion protection and
   latency control for DetNet flows at the DetNet transport layer.
   However, the ability to manage node and link resources to be able to
   provide these functions will be a necessary part of the DetNet
   control and management planes.  It will also be necessary to be able
   to signal or provision the required queuing disciplines needed to
   provide these functions along a flow's path through the network.  See
   Section 7.6 for further discussion of these requirements.

7.4.  Bidirectional traffic

   Some DetNet applications generate bidirectional traffic.  Using MPLS
   definitions [RFC5654] there are associated bidirectional flows, and
   co-routed bidirectional flows.  MPLS defines a point-to-point
   associated bidirectional LSP as consisting of two unidirectional
   point-to-point LSPs, one from A to B and the other from B to A, which
   are regarded as providing a single logical bidirectional transport
   path.  This would be analogous of standard IP routing, or PWs running
   over two reciprocal unidirection LSPs.  MPLS defines a point-to-point
   co-routed bidirectional LSP as an associated bidirectional LSP which
   satisfies the additional constraint that its two unidirectional
   component LSPs follow the same path (in terms of both nodes and
   links) in both directions.  An important property of co-routed
   bidirectional LSPs is that their unidirectional component LSPs share
   fate.  In both types of bidirectional LSPs, resource allocations may
   differ in each direction.  The concepts of associated bidirectional
   flows and co-routed bidirectional flows can be applied to DetNet
   flows as well whether IPv6 or MPLS is used.

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


   While the IPv6 and MPLS data planes must support bidirectional DetNet
   flows, there are no special bidirectional features with respect to
   the data plane other than need for the two directions take the same
   paths.  Fate sharing and associated vs co-routed bidirectional flows
   can be managed at the control level.  Note, that there is no stated
   requirement for bidirectional DetNet flows to be supported using the
   same IPv6 Flow Labels or MPLS Labels in each direction.

   DetNet's use of PREOF increases the difficulty of using co-routing
   bidirectional flows, since the replication points in one direction
   would have to match the recombination points in the other direction,
   and vice versa, and the optimal points for these functions in one
   direction may not match the optimal points in the other.  The ability
   to use co-routed bidirectional flows alongside PREOF is for future
   study.

   Control and management mechanisms will need to support bidirectional
   flows for both IPv6 and MPLS, but the specification of such
   mechanisms are out of scope of this document.  This is further
   discussed in Section 7.6.

7.5.  Flow aggregation control

   Section 6.7 discusses the use of flow aggregation in DetNet.  It
   includes flow aggregation accomplished through the use of
   hierarchical LSPs, aggregating multiple DetNet flows into a single
   new DetNet flow, and simple aggregation at the DetNet layer.  It will
   be the responsibility of the DetNet control and management plane to
   be able to properly signal and/or provision the use of these
   mechanisms.  These requirements are included in the next section.

7.6.  DetNet Control and Management Plane Requirements

   While the definition of control and management planes for DetNet is
   out of the scope of this document, there are particular
   considerations and requirements for such that result from the unique
   characteristics of the DetNet architecture
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and data plane as defined herein.

   The primary requirements of the DetNet control and management planes
   are that they must be able to:

   o  Instantiate DetNet flows in a DetNet domain (which includes
      explicit path and PREOF replication and recombination node
      determination, link bandwidth reservations, node buffer and other
      resource reservations, specification of required queuing
      disciplines along the path, ability to manage bidirectional flows,
      etc.)

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


   o  Manage DetNet S-Label allocation and distribution, when the DetNet
      MPLS encapsulation is in use

   o  The ability to support DetNet flow aggregation

   o  Advertise node and link resources, capabilities and adjacencies,
      both static and dynamic, to other network nodes (for dynamic
      signaling approaches) or to network controllers (for centralized
      approaches)

   o  Scale to handle a large number of DetNet flows in a domain (which
      may require per-flow signaling or provisioning)

   These requirements, as stated earlier, could be satisfied using
   distributed control protocol signaling (such as RSVP-TE) or
   centralized network management provisioning mechanisms.  When using
   the latter, the path could be implemented via MPLS-based segment
   routing.

   In the abstract, the results of either distributed signaling or
   centralized provisioning are equivalent from a DetNet data plane
   perspective - flows are instantiated, explicit routes are determined,
   resources are reserved, and packets are forwarded through the domain
   using the MPLS data plane.

   However, from a practical and implementation standpoint, they are not
   equivalent at all.  Some approaches are more scalable than others in
   terms of signaling load on the network.  Some can take advantage of
   global tracking of resources in the DetNet domain for better overall
   network resource optimization.  Some are more resilient than others
   if link, node, or management equipment failures occur.  While a
   detailed analysis of the control plane alternatives is out of the
   scope of this document, the requirements from this document can be
   used as the basis of a later analysis of the alternatives.

       Figure 17: DetNet Enabled MPLS Network over a TSN sub-network

   The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of the IEEE 802.1
   Working Group have defined (and are defining) a number of amendments
   to IEEE 802.1Q [IEEE8021Q] that provide zero congestion loss and
   bounded latency in bridged networks.  Furthermore IEEE 802.1CB
   [IEEE8021CB] defines frame replication and elimination functions for
   reliability that should prove both compatible with and useful to,
   DetNet networks.  All these functions have to identify flows those
   require TSN treatment.

   As is the case for DetNet, a Layer 2 network node such as a bridge
   may need to identify the specific DetNet flow to which a packet
   belongs in order to provide the TSN/DetNet QoS for that packet.  It
   also may need a CoS marking, such as the priority field of an IEEE
   Std 802.1Q VLAN tag, to give the packet proper service.

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


   The challange for MPLS DeNet flows is that the protocol interworking
   function defined in IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB] works only for IP
   flows.  The aim of the protocol interworking function is to convert
   an ingress flow to use a specific multicast destination MAC address
   and VLAN, for example to direct the packets through a specific path
   inside the bridged network.  A similar interworking pair at the other
   end of the TSN sub-network would restore the packet to its original
   destination MAC address and VLAN.

   As protocol interworking function defined in [IEEE8021CB] does not
   work for MPLS labeled flows, the MPLS DetNet nodes MUST ensure proper
   TSN sub-network specific Ethernet encapsulation of the MPLS DetNet
   packets.  For a given TSN Stream (i.e., DetNet flow) an MPLS (DetNet)
   node MUST behave as a TSN-aware Talker or a Listener inside the TSN
   sub-network.

10.1.  Mapping of TSN Stream ID and Sequence Number

   TSN capable MPLS (DetNet) nodes are TSN-aware Talker/Listener as
   shown in Figure 18.  MPLS (DetNet) node MUST provide the TSN sub-
   network specific Ethernet encapsulation over the link(s) towards the
   sub-network.  An TSN-aware MPLS (DetNet) node MUST support the
   following TSN components:

   1.  For recognizing flows:

       *  Stream Identification (MPLS-flow-aware)

   2.  For FRER used inside the TSN domain, additonaly:

       *  Sequencing function (MPLS-flow-aware)

       *  Sequence encode/decode function

   3.  For FRER when the node is a TSN replication or elimination point,
       additionally:

       *  Stream splitting function

       *  Individual recovery function

   [Editor's note: Should we added here requirements regarding IEEE
   802.1Q C-VLAN component?]

   The Stream Identification and The Sequencing functions are slightly
   modified for frames passed down the protocol stack from the upper
   layers.

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS Data Plane            February 2019


   Stream Identification MUST pair MPLS flows and TSN Streams and encode
   that in data plane formats as well.  The packet's stream_handle
   subparameter (see IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB]) inside the Talker/
   Listener is defined based on the Flow-ID used in the upper MPLS
   DetNet layer.  Stream Identification function MUST encode Ethernet
   header fields namely (1) the destination MAC-address, (2) the VLAN-ID
   and (3) priority parameters with TSN sub-network specific values.
   Encoding is provided for the frame passed down the stack from the
   upper layers.

   The sequence generation function resides in the Sequencing function.
   It generates a sequence_number subparameter for each packet of a
   Stream passed down to the lower layers.  Sequencing function MUST
   copy sequence information from the MPLS d-CW of the packet to the
   sequence_number subparameter for the frame passed down the stack from
   the upper layers.

   The Sequence encode/decode function MUST support the Redundancy tag
   (R-TAG) format as per Clause 7.8 of IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB].

10.2.  TSN Usage of FRER

   TSN Streams supporting DetNet flows may use Frame Replication and
   Elimination for Redundancy (FRER) [802.1CB] based on the loss service
   requirements of the TSN Stream, which is derived from the DetNet
   service requirements of the DetNet mapped flow.  The specific

   operation of FRER is not modified by the use of DetNet and follows
   IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB].

   FRER function and the provided service recovery is available only
   within the TSN sub-network however as the Stream-ID and the TSN
   sequence number are paired with the MPLS flow parameters they can be
   combined with PREOF functions.

11.  DetNet MPLS Transport Layer Operation over IP DetNet PSNs

   This section specifies the DetNet encapsulation over an IP transport
   network.  The approach is modeled on the operation of MPLS and
   PseudoWires (PW) over an IP Packet Switched Network (PSN)
   [RFC3985][RFC4385][RFC7510].  It is also based on the MPLS data plane
   encapsulation described in Section 6.2.

   To carry DetNet with full functionality at the DetNet layer over an
   IP transport network, the following components are required (these
   are a subset of the requirements for MPLS encapsulation listed in
   Section 6.1):

   1.  A method of identifying the DetNet flow group to the processing
       element.

   2.  A method of carrying the DetNet sequence number.

   3.  A method of distinguishing DetNet OAM packets from DetNet data
       packets.

   4.  A method of carrying queuing and forwarding indication.

   These requirements are satisfied by the DetNet over MPLS
   Encapsulation described in Section 6.2.

   To simplify operations and implementations, rather than inventing a
   new encapsulation, the IP encapsulation takes advantage of the MPLS
   encapsulation.  By using the specification of MPLS over UDP and IP in
   [RFC7510], the T-Label(s) shown in Figure 15 in Section 6.2 can be
   replaced by UDP and IP, resulting in the following encapsulation:

   Where the UDP header is used as defined in Section 3 of [RFC7510].

   As in Section 6.2, the S-Label is used to identify a DetNet flow to
   the peer node that processes it, in this case the node addressed by
   the IP Header in Figure 19.  The S-Label is allocated from the
   receiving node?s platform label space [RFC3031].

   In ingress Edge Nodes, the encapsulation in Figure 19 will be imposed
   on Detnet Flow Payload Packets as received from DetNet End Systems,
   and the encapsulation will be removed in egress Edge Nodes as they
   transmit the Payload Packets to the End Systems.

   Note that this encapsulation works equally well with IPv4 and IPv6.

   This encapsulation can also be used in conjunction with segment
   routing as specified in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls].  In
   this case, the T-Label(s) in Figure 19 should be retained, and at
   each hop, the top T-label is popped and mapped to a corresponding
   UDP/IP tunnel, resulting in the following encapsulation:

   Again, the UDP header is used as defined in Section 3 of [RFC7510].

   Note that if required in both the case of IP Encapsulation of DetNet
   Figure 19, and of IP Encapsulation of DetNet with MPLS-SR Figure 20,
   it is possible to omit the UDP header if required.  Operation of MPLS
   directly over IP is described in [RFC4023].  In this case DetNet
