  <t> From a connection type perspective, three scenarios are distinguished:
    <list style="numbers">
	<t>
     Directly attached: end-system is directly connected to an edge node.
    </t>
	<t>
     Indirectly attached: end-system is behind a (L2-TSN / L3-DetNet)
     sub-network.
    </t>
	<t>
     DN integrated: end-system is part of the DetNet domain.
    </t>
    </list>
  </t>

  <t>
   L3 end-systems may use any of these connection types, however L2 end-systems
   may use only the first two (directly or indirectly attached). DetNet domain
   MUST allow communication between any end-systems of the same type (L2-L2,
   L3-L3), independent of their connection type and DetNet capability. However
   directly attached and indirectly attached end-systems have no knowledge about
   the DetNet domain and its encapsulation format at all. See <xref target="fig_es_con_types"/>
   for L3 end-system scenarios.

 <section title="DetNet Layer Two Service">

  <t>
   The simplest DetNet service is to provide tunneling for layer two,
   where the connected hosts are in the same broadcast (BC) domain. Forwarding
   over the DetNet domain is based on L2 (MAC) addresses (i.e. dst-MAC),
   or on received interface <xref target="RFC3985"/>. In both cases
   the L2 headers MUST either be kept, or provision must be made for their
   reconstruction at egress from the DetNet domain.

<section title="DetNet Inter-Working Function (DN-IWF)">

<section title="Networks with multiple technology segments" anchor="nwsegments">

  <t>
   There are networking scenarios, where the DetNet domain contains multiple technology segments (IP,
   MPLS, ..) and all those segments are under the same administrative control (see <xref
   target="fig_pref_xcrs_segments"/>). Furthermore, DetNet nodes may be interconnected via TSN
   segments.
  </t>

  <t> An important aspect of DetNet network design is the placement of DetNet functions across the
  domain. Designs based on segment-by-segment optimization can provide only sub-optimal solutions. In
  order to achieve global optimized Inter-Working Functions (DN-IWF) can be
  placed at segment edge
  nodes, which stitch together DetNet flows across connected segments.    </t>

  <t> DN-IWF may ensure that flow attributes are correlated across segment edges. For example,
  there are two DetNet functions which require Sequence Numbers: (1) PEF: removes duplications
  from flows and (2) POF: ensures in-order-delivery of packet in a flow. Stitching flows together
  and correlating attributes means for example that replication of packets can happen in one segment
  and elimination of duplicates in a different one.   </t>

<section title="DN-IWF related considerations">

  <t> The goal of DN-IWF is to (1) match and (2) translate segment specific flow attributes. The DN-IWF ensures that segment specific attributes comprise per domain unique attributes for the whole DetNet domain. This characteristic can ensure that DetNet functions can be based on per domain attributes and not per segment attributes.
  </t>

  <t> The two DetNet specific attributes have the following characteristics:
  <list style="symbols">
   <t> Flow-ID: it is same in all packets of a flow </t>
   <t> Sequence Number: it is different packet-by-packet </t>
  </list>
  </t>

  <t> For the Flow-ID the DN-IWF can implement a static mapping. The situation is more complicated for Sequence Number as it is different packet-by-packet, so it may need more sophisticated translation unless its format is exactly the same in the two technology segments. In this later case the DN-IWF can simple copy the Sequence Number field between the tunneling encapsulation of the two technology segments.
  </t>

  <t> In case of three technology segments (IP, MPLS and TSN) three DN-IWF functions can be specified. In the rest of this section the focus is on the (1) IP - MPLS network scenario. Note: the use-cases are out-of-scope for (2) TSN - IP, (3) TSN - MPLS.
  </t>

  <t> Simplest implementation of DN-IWF is provided if the flow attributes have the same format. Such a common denominator of the tunnel encapsulation format is the pseudowire encapsulation over both IP and MPLS.
